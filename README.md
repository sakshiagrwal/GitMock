- The `gitpython` and `datetime` modules

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required modules: `pip install gitpython datetime`
3. Run the script: `python main.py`

## Configuration

The number of commits to generate can be modified by changing the value of `n` in the `make_commit` function.

## Disclaimer

Use this code at your own risk. It is intended for testing purposes only and should not be used to manipulate or mislead others.
